Petrophysics/Units version 0.01
===============================

Yes, "Yet Another Unit Conversion Module".

Honestly, all of them are slightly different, and it's not trivial to make
a common unit conversion module.  Different people have different needs.

Please check out
    Math::Units
    Physics::Unit
on CPAN to see if any of those are more appropriate for what you want to do.

This module takes a database-like view on units of measurement.  In particular,
this module is based on the following POSC (c) products:
   - epsgUnits.xml
   - poscUnits.xml
These files can be downloaded from http://www.posc.org.  Please see
http://www.posc.org/ebiz/pefxml/patternsobjects.html#units
                                                                                
Due to the POSC Product License Agreement, these files are *not*
distributed in their original form.  Please get the originals directly from
POSC.

For this module, the dictionaries of unit of measurement provided by POSC have
been reformatted to a "database" of perl objects.  The database is just an
ordinary perl source code file containing a "Data::Dumper" representation of
the original xml objects.  The perl objects are blessed into a class
where methods for database search/lookup and unit conversion are provided. 

The conversion utility (parse_units) is provided so that users can redo the
conversion from the POSC files if needed/wanted.  The conversion utility is
dependent on modules for parsing XML::LibXML and Data::Dumper.

INSTALLATION
